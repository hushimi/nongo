  backend:
    - create signup api in LoginController.java
      - user should input user_name, email and password
      - validation rule
        - user_name: a-z, A-Z, 0-9, more than 5 character (implemented as 6+ alphanumeric)
        - email: valid email type
        - password: more than 8 character, must include number and '!@?_#&'
    - created SignupRequest DTO with validation annotations
    - created UsersService with signup method (checks for duplicate user_name and email)
    - added signup endpoint to LoginController with validation logic
    - updated SecurityConfig to allow /signup endpoint
    - create login api and issue JWT token with HTTP only cookie
    - currently, this app make request to /api/software-engineers to check if token is valid
      - create /api/is-token-valid API(POST) in LoginController
      - this api just return token is valid or not(don't return 401 error)
    - create logout api
  frontend:
    - create signup page using tailwind and daisyUI
      - created reusable TextInput component
      - created reusable PasswordInput component with toggle visibility
      - created signup page at /signup with form using Tailwind and DaisyUI
    - create login page
    - once login is succeeded, move to top page. When user have JWT token, software engineer list menu will be shown
    - fix auth.ts to use is-token-valid api(AuthenticationApi.ts)
    - create common header component
      - Left side: nongo application menu(link to top page)
      - Right side menu:
        - If is-token-valid result is true, display logout button
          - create logout function using generated type script client class(AuthenticationApi.class)
        - IF is-token-valid result is false, display SignUp and Log In button
    - once logout request is succeeded, move to top page, software engineer list can not be shown. Just login and signup menu
  integration:
    - regenerated OpenAPI client types (npm run gen-tscode)
    - updated signup page to use generated AuthenticationApi.signupRaw with handleApiPost
    - signup page now uses api.ts utility for consistent error handling
